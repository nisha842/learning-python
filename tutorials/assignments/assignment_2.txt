1. Write code to print multiplication of 2?
2. Extend above code to print multiplication from 1 to 10?
Hint: use f-string to print and use "\n" to print enter

3. Reason the problem and fix the error

# problem 1
for number in [1, 2, 3, 4]
    sq_list.append(number * number)

# problem 2
def dummy_function(number)
    sq = number * i
    return i
dummy_function(3) = 9

# problem 3
def divide_by_3(number):
    if number % 3 = 0:
    return True
    else:
    return False

divide_by_3(2) = False
divide_by_3(9) = True

# problem 4
write example of list and dict with different methods
